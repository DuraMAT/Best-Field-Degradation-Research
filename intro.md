# Welcome to the Bifacial Experimental Single-Axis Tracking (BEST) Field Degradation Research Tutorials

Here is a collection of Jupyter Journals that include tutorials and tools.
These are ready to read, install and use, or run in your browser through Google Collab.
Clicking on the rocket-icon on the top allows you to launch the journals on
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for interactive mode.
As per the instructions on each journal, you should uncomment the first line
that reads `pip install ...`  to install the environment if you follow this mode.

You can also clone the repository and run them locally, following the
instructions on the [Best-Field-Degradation-Research page](https://github.com/DuraMAT/Best-Field-Degradation-Research)
